> IMPORTANT: This is based on work done by [thecodejunkie](https://github.com/thecodejunkie) on the [expandinzr](https://github.com/thecodejunkie/github.expandinizr) project. I take no credit for the work to make github wider.

I started with a new project because I wanted to learn how to make my own chrome extension. I would like to add more tweaks to make github easier to deal with, given time.

If you want to fool with this, feel free. Send me a pull request, if I like the changes I'll integrate them.
